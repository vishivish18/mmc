              <h1 className="section-header">Vision and Philosphy</h1>
              <p>
                    We envision spreading awareness about music and benefits of learning to play an instrument. We use music as a way to unwind and relieve stress, and also to train your mind to focus. And we believe that there is no specific age to learn. So why not make your dream of becoming a rockstar come true?  Whether you're a student or a working professional, we accommodate everyone. We have always supported our students to help them discover and create their own music.We have chosen to keep our prices below that of most music schools; so that, students focus on their desire to learn. We also have special programs for the under-privileged who cannot afford the classes or even the instrument. We provide them with the instruments or classes at a very low cost or sometimes for free.
